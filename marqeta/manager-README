# Hi, I am Ashik

This document is my attempt to explain you what to expect from me if I am your manager. This README applies only to me and no other manager or team at Marqeta. Also it's a living document which means I will keep updating it as I optimize myself for Marqeta.

Two management styles that most rewsonate with me are 'Situational Leadership' and 'Servant Leadership'. I look forward to your feedback on how it can be most useful for you. My job is to attract and retain top engineers and managers (i.e. you). My job is also to provide you context so that you can carry out your job.

Depending on your role, I expect you to be good at some of the below skills (I believe no one person can be very good at all of those) -

* code quality
* design and architecture
* debugging / troubleshooting
* project management
* communication
* responsiveness
* reaching consensus
* delegating work
* time management
* working well with others (lead with strength, compensate for weakness)
* feedback
* bringing new ideas
* technical documentation
* mentorship
* influencing others

Over-communicate. With me and with your team.

Ask for relevant books, trainings, seminars that will help you in your work and professional growth.

Be kind, be constructive but don't hold back. Problems need to be addressed at their early stages so that we have more paths to resolve. The later we encounter or discover a problem, the lesser is our options.

I want to apply 'Disagree and Commit' principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit) as a last report, only occassionally. If it comes too many times, it's a sign of something to be improved or addressed.

I like technical debates, within the team or across or with me as long as we can still enjoy our company later in the day or week.

I am pretty good with context switches as it is a required skill for my job. So if you need time from me, don't hesitate to ask face-to-face or slack right away. Don't assume I am too busy. I do some important work here at Marqeta but hardly any of those are as important as talking to you. So if you need to talk to me, schedule a time in my calendar even if all my slots are booked. I will prioritize your one or reach out to you with a time that works for both of us.

I don't want to micro-manage, its not a good use of my time or yours. I plan to empower you and hold you accountable for your works.

Use good judgement. I am accountable for most decisions you make even if i don't make those. You make your decision but you are not exempt from explaining why you made that decision. I will have a hard conversation with you if I believe your judgement is consistently unsound. But disagreeing with me doesn't mean your judgement is bad. You’ll still need to get consensus, agreement, and input from your teammates.

I sometimes work around the clock including after hours and weekends. But I don't expect you to work outside of office hours.  I may leave you slack message or email after hours but you don't need to respond immediately unless I clearly mention it's an emergency which should be a rare case. For all non-emergency messages from me, those can wait until you are in office next day. The reason I may send you those messages off-hour is mostly because I will forget to send you the message otherwise. Slack’s ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode is a great feature.

I will have 1-on-1 with you every week for half an hour. But you may change the frequency or length, just express your interest and reasoning and I will adjust accordingly.

I value transparency about what’s happened, what’s happening, and what’s going to happen.

I want to give and receive feedbacks. Not only feedbacks for me and for yourselvers but also about the people and team you work most with.

If you are a remote employee, or if you work remotely for some temporary time, I will expect a weekly status update from you every Friday afternoon on your key work items that week. Also please check out go/homereimbursement for setting up your home office.

If you see a discrepancy between this readme and my behavior, please tell me. Understand that I am learning too, and you can help me to be a better leader.
